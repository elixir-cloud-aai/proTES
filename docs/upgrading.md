# Upgrading

The [release notes](changelog.md) list the breaking changes of each release
and how to upgrade. This page describes how existing setups and data are
affected by changes since the last deployed version (images tagged by date,
FOCA 0.12).

## Configuration

Since the upgrade to FOCA 0.15, custom configs must apply the config changes
of FOCA 0.14 and 0.15 (see the FOCA release notes and migration guides),
e.g., `exceptions.mapping` instead of the old exception members, and no
`validation_methods`, `validation_checks`, `environment` or `use_reloader`.
The service info is configured in `service_info.service` (see [Service
info](configuration.md#service-info)); it is no longer stored in the
database, so the `service_info` collection can be dropped.

## Errors

Errors are [problem details](api.md#errors) (`title`, `status`, `detail`)
instead of objects with `message` and `code`.

## Stored tasks

`logs[].metadata.forwarded_to` of tasks is a list of forwards (`id`, `url`,
`forward_time`), in the order of forwarding, instead of a nested
`tesNextTes` object. Tasks stored by earlier versions are still read, and
served with their forwards as lists; they can be tracked and canceled as
before.

## Middleware management API

The middleware management API is no longer registered, as its controllers
don't exist yet (see [Middleware management
API](middlewares.md#middleware-management-api)).

## Image

The image installs proTES as a package: it serves the app with `gunicorn
--config python:pro_tes.gunicorn_config 'pro_tes.app:init_app()'` (its
default command), and runs the Celery worker with `celery --app
pro_tes.celery_worker worker`. `/app/pro_tes`, `gunicorn.py` and `wsgi.py` are
gone, and the environment variables `GUNICORN_PROCESSES` and
`GUNICORN_THREADS` are replaced by `GUNICORN_CMD_ARGS` (see
[Server](configuration.md#server)). The Helm chart 3.0.0 needs images of this
version, and earlier charts need earlier images.

## Docker Compose

Docker Compose runs MongoDB 7.0 (was 3.6, which current PyMongo releases
can't connect to), and keeps the data in named volumes instead of
`PROTES_DATA_DIR` (default `../data/pro_tes`), whose data is not migrated.
MongoDB can't upgrade data files from 3.6 to 7.0 directly: dump the data with
the old version (`mongodump`) and restore it into the new one
(`mongorestore`), or start with an empty database. Only proTES (and Flower,
now opt-in) are published, on `127.0.0.1`.
